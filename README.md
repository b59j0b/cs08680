1. (20 points) Consider the vectors:(a) Determine whether or not the set of vectors {⃗v1, ⃗v2, ⃗v3} is linearly dependent or linearly independent.



(b) Determine whether or not the set of vectors { ⃗w1, ⃗w2, ⃗w3, ⃗w4} is linearly dependent or linearlyindependent. (Hint: No row reduction is necessary to answer this.)





2. (20 points) Consider the linear system of equations A⃗x = ⃗b with augmented matrix





In(a)–(c), a matrix



in echelon form. which is row equivalent to the augmented matrix is given.In each case, determine whether the original system:(i) is inconsistent(ii) has a unique solution(iii) has infinitely many solutions; in this case, find the general solution.





3. (20 points)Find a number b so that the matrix







is singular.
